        A Dedicated Software Engineer

        I am a Junior Software Engineer and a recent graduate with a Bachelor's
        in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering. During my
        time at university, I built a strong foundation in key computer science
        principles such as algorithms, data structures, and database systems. My
        passion for web development grew through hands-on projects, where I
        learned how to design and build practical, scalable applications.
